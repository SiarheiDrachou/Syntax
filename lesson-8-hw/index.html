<h4> Subjects of study </h4>
<p> At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have
    a pretty open-minded research facility - 
    as long as the subjects fall somewhere in
    the realm of science and technology. You
    seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher,
    and just the kind of person we'd like to have 
    on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you
    submitted we were most intrigued by are as 
    follows , in order of priority:
    <ol>
        <li>
            Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and
            the health benefits of Resveratrol
            (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)
        </li>
        <li>
            Measuring the effect on performance of funk
            bassplayers at tempratures exceeding 30&deg;C
            (86&deg;F), when the audience size exponentialy
            increases (effect of 3 &times; 10<sup>3</sup> >
            3 &times; 10<sup>4</sup>.)
        </li>
        <li> 
            <abbr 
                title="HyperText Markup Language">
                HTML
            </abbr>
            and
            <abbr 
                title="Cascading Style Sheets">
                CSS
            </abbr>
            constructs for representing musical scores.
        </li>
    </ol>
    So please can you provide more information on each
    of these subjects, including how long you'd expect
    the research to take, requaired staff and other
    resources, and anything else you think we'd need
    to know? Thanks.
